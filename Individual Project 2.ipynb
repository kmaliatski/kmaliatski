    "1\\. Plumbing Inc. has been selling plumbing supplies for the last 20 years. The owner, Joe, decides that next year it is finally time to diversify by adding gardening tools to his products. Having had success using customer data to build predictive models to guide direct mail campaigns for special plumbing offers, he considers that data mining could help him to identify a subset of customers who should be good prospects for his new set of products. Is Joe ready to solve this as a supervised learning problem? What would you suggest as the target variable? Be precise. Is there anything else that you would recommend that Joe do to achieve his business goal? "
