# Project Repository

This repository contains several of my projects. Below is a brief overview of each:

### Project 1: R Project | Report on Expedia Price Sensitivity and Consumer Behavior
- This report analyzes Expedia’s experimental data collected through randomized price variations across several U.S. markets using R.
- You can download the report in PDF format: [Report on Expedia Price Sensitivity and Consumer Behavior](./401%20Homework%201.pdf)

### Project 2: R Project | Superhost: Airbnb in Paris
- The objective of this analysis is to uncover what differs ‘Superhosts’ from regular Airbnb hosts using R.
- You can view the R script for the project: [Superhost: Airbnb in Paris Code](./Final_Project.R)
